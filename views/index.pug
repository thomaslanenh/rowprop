  p This tool takes a XLSX file and transfers it into HubSpot properties. There are some limitations to this though:
    ol
      li Enumeration isn't supported at this time.
      li Bool, booleancheckbox, calculation_equation and checkboxes do not work as of this moment.
      li Does not (as of this moment) create custom objects
  p The API Requires the following scopes:
    ol
      li contacts
      li companies
      li custom objects
      li deals
      li e-commerce
      li products
      li tickets
  p plus any other scopes you need to interact with the object.
  h2 You must use the Object Type's ID and not the object type's label on the spreadsheet! i.e. 0-1 instead of "Contacts"
  i You can find it by going to your object in HubSpot then looking at the url. For example if you have the url https://app.hubspot.com/contacts/22311609/objects/2-7916663/views/all/list for object "Planets" then the  object type ID would be #[strong 2-7916663]
  p If you have any questions or run into any weird errors, please get in touch with #[a(href="mailto:matt@aptitude8.com") Matt] or #[a(href="mailto:thomas@aptitude8.com") Thomas].
