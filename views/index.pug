  p This tool takes a XLSX file and transfers it into HubSpot properties. There are some limitations to this though:
    ol
      li Enumeration isn't supported at this time.
      li Bool, booleancheckbox, calculation_equation and checkboxes do not work as of this moment.
      li Does not (as of this moment) create custom objects
  p The API Requires the following scopes:
    ol
      li contacts
      li companies
      li custom objects
      li deals
      li e-commerce
      li products
      li tickets
  h2 You must use the Objects ID and not the label!
  p If you have any questions or run into any weird errors, please get in touch with #[a(href="mailto:matt@aptitude8.com") Matt] or #[a(href="mailto:thomas@aptitude8.com") Thomas].
